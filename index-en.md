### Scientific Research

- This paper mainly studies the semantic understanding and application of visual images, including image quality improvement, multi-level semantic modeling and the promotion and application of algorithms. Specifically, the quality of the image level recognition system is improved by focusing on the relationship between the image and the interference, the performance of the image level recognition system is improved by focusing on the relationship between the targets, the performance of the target level recognition system is improved by focusing on the relationship between the samples, and the performance of the pixel level recognition system is improved by focusing on the relationship between the pixels. In addition, the theoretical research results have been applied to road crack detection, micro nano remote sensing satellite imaging, complex military scene interpretation and other practical tasks, and achieved good performance.
